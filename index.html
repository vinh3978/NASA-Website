        Space exploration began only 60 years ago and look at where we are now!
        <br /><br />
        The first man in space was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. He completed
        one orbit of the Earth and beat the Americans to space by only a few
        months. Some other famous firsts include the first satellite launched
        into space in 1957. The first animal in space was Laika the dog, also in
        1957. John Glenn was the first American in space in 1962. Neil Armstrong
        was the first man to walk on the Moon in 1969. The first private
        commercial space mission happened in 2012 when SpaceX send an unmanned
        capsule with supplies to the International Space Station. Just last
        year, in 2021, the original captain of Star Trek's Enterprise, William
        Shatner, became the oldest person in space at the age of 90 years old.
        In 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield created the first music video in space.
        <br />
        <br />
        Only 9 Canadians have ever been in space. Marc Garneau was the first to
        go to space in 1984. In 2013, Canadian Col. Chris Hadfield joined the
        crew of the International Space Station. He became famous during his
        mission to space by documenting the daily life of an astronaut (such as
        "how astronauts sleep") using social media and by sharing breathtaking
        photographs on his Twitter account. He also charmed his fans with his
        rendition of David Bowie's "Space Oddity". <br />
