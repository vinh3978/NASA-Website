      Our solar system is centered on the Sun, a star. There are 8 planets that
      revolve around the Sun, bound to it by gravity. To get an idea about the
      relative size and distances of the objects in our solar system, this site

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        Mercury does not have any moons or rings. It is the smallest planet and
        is the closest planet to the Sun. Mercury has the largest orbital
        eccentricity of all our planets because its distance from the Sun ranges
        from 46 million KM to 70 million KM.

        <h2>Venus</h2>
        Even though Venus is farther from the Sun than Mercury, it is the
        hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is almost exactly the same
        size as Earth. Venus is the second brightest object in our sky, only the
        Moon is brighter. It can even, occasionally, during daytime be seen on a
        clear day! The atmospheric pressure on Venus is almost 100 times greater
        than that of Earth. Venus was the first planet to have its motion
        plotted across the sky. <br />

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        The name "Earth" is at least 1000 years old, all the planets except
        Earth were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. Earth is the
        only planet with liquid water on the surface. If the Sun was as tall as
        a typical front door, then, relative to the Sun, Earth would be the size
        of a nickel. Earth's atmosphere protects it from incoming meteorites
        because most of them break apart before they can strike the surface. The
        first Earth Day started in 1970 on April 22 with hopes of increasing
        awareness about the importance of protecting our planet. <br />

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        Also known as the Red Planet, Mars is smaller than Earth. One day on
        Mars is almost exactly the same length as a day on Earth. The atmosphere
        on Mars is very thin, meaning it can't trap the Sun's heat very well, so
        it is very cold. The gravity is very weak, on Mars you can jump 3X
        higher than you can on Earth. Mars is tilted at a 25 degree angle so it
        has seasons similar to Earth when different parts of the planet are
        closer to the Sun. <br />

        Jupiter is over 300 times more massive than Earth. It is not only the
        largest planet but it is 2.5 times more massive than ALL the other
        planets in our solar system combined. It is also the fastest spinning
        planet in our solar system. It only takes 10 hours to complete one
        rotation on its axis. Jupiter has at least 67 moons (named and confirmed
        natural satellites). It has four major moons called Io, Europa, Ganymede
        and Calisto. It is the third brightest object in our sky. <br />

        Saturn is the farthest planet from Earth that can be seen without a
        telescope. Saturn orbits the Sun every 29.4 Earth years. It has the most
        rings of any planet in our solar system. The rings are made up of ice
        and carbonaceous dust. They stretch out 120000 km from the planet but
        are surprisingly thin, only 20 meters thick. Saturn has over 150 moons
        and moonlets, the largest 2 are called Titan and Rhea. <br />

        Uranus is the coldest planet in our solar system. It was the first

        it wasn't till 1781 that astronomers realized it was a planet. It is
        named after the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. Uranus is tilted must
        more than the other planets, the other planets are like spinning tops
        but Uranus is more like a rolling ball as it orbits the Sun. <br />

        The farthest planet from the Sun is Neptune. It was discovered in 1846.
        When the dwarf planet of Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was thought
        that Pluto was the farthest planet from the Sun but Pluto's orbit is
        very elliptical so there are periods where Pluto is actually close to
        the Sun than Neptune. Neptune's surface gravity is very similar to
        Earth. It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching up to
        2,100 km/hour. <br />
